* `Cake: Install a configuration file` to install the default Cake Configuration file for controlling internal components of Cake.

## What is Cake?

Cake (C# Make) is a cross platform build automation system with a C# DSL to do things like compiling code, copy files/folders, running unit tests, compress files and build NuGet packages.
